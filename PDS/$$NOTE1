Hi Sam,

This is my first CBT contribution.

It is a Rexx procedure that will convert a TCP/IP packet trace
(ctrace) dataset into Unix tcpdump format.

I use it so that I can browse OS/390 packet traces on Windows in
full color using the freeware packet capture/decoder program
called Ethereal (www.ethereal.com). Ethereal is supported on many
other platforms and using it is IMHO far superior to trawling
through a printed packet trace.

It has been tested on OS/390 2.10 and z/OS 1.4 and depends on the
(undocumented) format of the ctrace dataset.


Cheers,
Andrew Armstrong
